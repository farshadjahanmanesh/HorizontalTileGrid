/// HorizontalTileGrid layouts it's subviews horizontally based on given block types. if no height is provided for HorizontalTileGrid, its height would be equal to the biggest subview and the its width would be calculated as big as the total size of the block types.
/// the simplest block type is ``BlockType``.block that is a square that fills its side fills the HorizontalTileGrid's height.
///
/// ``BlockType`` supported by HorizontalTileGrid are `block`, `double`, and `blockCustom`
