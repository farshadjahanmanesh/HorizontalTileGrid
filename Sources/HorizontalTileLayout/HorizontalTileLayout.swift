/// There are three ``BlockType``:
///
///
/// **fullCustom(width: CGFloat)**:
/// 	This subview will have a custom width. it will fill the HorizontalTileLayout and a width equal to the provided value.
///
/// **half**:
/// 	If a subview is of type HalfSquare, Layout divides the available height in half and places the item on top or bottom space based on the order of appearance of the item in list. Layout would always start from top half, places the subview on the top half and goes to the next view, if the next item is a another half again, the layout places the new item in the bottom half, but if the next item is not of half display type, the bottom half would be empty
///
///	**full**:
///		This display type is a standard square and provides a space of Width=Height=HorizontalTileLayout height.
